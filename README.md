# Automotive Suspension System Simulation

This project involves the design and simulation of a quarter-car suspension system using MATLAB Simulink. The goal is to analyze the dynamics of a vehicle‚Äôs suspension and improve ride comfort through passive components (spring and damper) and active control using a PID controller.

## üöó Project Overview

The simulation models the vertical dynamics of a quarter-car system subjected to road disturbances. Key features include:

- Accurate modeling of **spring** and **damper** forces.
- Real-time computation of **suspension forces** and **chassis displacement**.
- Integration of a **PID controller** to enhance ride comfort and reduce oscillations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Quarter-Car Model:** Simulates a simplified 2-DOF system representing vehicle body and wheel dynamics.
- **Passive Suspension Dynamics:** Calculates forces using Hooke‚Äôs Law for springs and damping equations.
- **Active Control:** Implements a PID controller to minimize body displacement and improve system response.
- **Road Input Simulation:** Supports bump, sine wave, or step road profiles as input to test suspension performance.

## üìä Outputs & Analysis

- Time-domain plots of **body displacement**, **wheel displacement**, and **suspension force**.
- Comparison of system behavior with and without PID control.
- Analysis of damping effects on ride quality and vehicle stability.

## üß∞ Tools Used

- **MATLAB R2023b** (or later)
- **Simulink**
- Simulink Scope and Dashboard components for visualization
